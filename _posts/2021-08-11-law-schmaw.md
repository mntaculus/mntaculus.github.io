I remember many a trad (including Ferrara) saying a Pope could destroy all patrimony of the Church (the liturgy and the churches around the world). But it wouldn't be wise.

That's the problem with laws, though: they create a sort of chimera, a life form that terrorizes those under the law and that the legislators could never predict.

To separate law and wisdom like that -- to say a monarch can lawfully destroy the common good, but that wouldn't be wise -- already shows part of the problem: we abandoned virtue and goodness for a sort of deontology.

That's why I don't really worry myself with such questions -- which careerist pope/patriarch excommunicated who -- the same way I worry about good liturgy (literally, orthodoxy).

I wonder where the TLM would be if Msgr. Lefebvre were to bother himself about following the letter of the law and not orthodoxy (though, of course, he argues his actions were lawful; and the pope did a very passive aggressive thing of excommunicating latae sententiae, but that's another matter -- still, a smaller man would have folded and we would be like the old catholics by now (yet maybe this is in the future)).
