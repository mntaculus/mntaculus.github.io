Of course, every persuasion has its hysteria. But I’m more familiar with right wing hysteria — probably because I follow more people who tend to the right, generally speaking.

Right wing hysteria is funny. The other day (today) we had an example of it. For some reason, Amazon had a glitch and it did not show some recent published books on its catalogue if you searched for it on the Amazon webpage.

Conservatives were up in arms: there was even a mention of the index librorum prohibitorum. One very influential conservative Catholic (from, gasp, Harvard) compared it to a tyrannical government.

Never mind the fact the books were still in the catalogue, the amazon page was the first result in the google search, one could buy it from amazon and receive it in time and in perfect condition (usual with amazon), one could buy it and read it on a kindle device instantly. Or you could, you know, buy from other places. You could contact the author directly on twitter and ask for a copy. You could e-mail the author (heck, the aforementioned conservative influencer would probably just read the e-mail on a nice Monday morning on an idyllic house in New England, completely lacking a dystopian satanic police apparatus that forces him to worship allah and do yoga — or something).

And many conservatives also were quick to point out that this was probably a glitch (probably a wrong syntax to fetch some data in some database, since you could find it on amazon from other countries) — it happened to many books that were not right wing, like Andy Weir’s new book.

But even though these were voices of reason, the hysteria persisted. The story that one was at war with the dark empire of Jeff Bezos was too seductive.

Of course, there is a sort of persecution. But come one. These people all have blue checks, have a place in academia and so on. Its really silly to say they are outcast in a battle against an evil empire. And probably a bit dangerous too — I mean, there’s a short distance between this and bolsolavismo (and *this* really destroys conservative thought)
