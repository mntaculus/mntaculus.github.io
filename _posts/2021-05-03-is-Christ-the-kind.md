Well, of course the answer is yes.

But I’d like to know what the *doctrine* of the Kingship of Christ implies for us.

I mean, surely this doctrine is not something we just consent with the will and go on about our day. Surely it has a practical content.

I like to compare it to the Eucharist: it has a practical content, its not just intellectual: its not just remembering alone. Its not even just getting together and telling stories. Its constructing a civilization capable of producing bread and wine. Implicit in the liturgical act there’s a need for building a sort of civilization.

Simillarly, what is the practical content of the Kingship of Christ? The integralists always say its the Kindship of Christ *over all things, including over the political order*.

Consequentelly, its not just the Kingship over my intellect and will, my actions, my house, my household, etc. Its a Kingship over commerce, the legislature, the judges, the city, etc.

That is, its not something just about me, or even about my community, but about all other people.

One way to know what this would ultimatelly means is: think, integralist, what would you do if you get all the power tomorrow. What would you do?

I mean, besides just legislating on the usual conservative talking points, like abortion and gay stuff. Maybe there’d be some distributism stuff. Maybe there’d be a sort of apartheid: the baptized against the non-baptized.

Ok, the most radical thing — meaning the most thing far from our current predicament — is the last one. The others we could think possible achieving just creating a party and participating in elections — vanilla, conservative stuff, really.

But creating second class citizens. That requires power. If this is the end (I don’t presume to talk on behalf of integralists, I’m just speculating here), then we should do it. Because the doctrine has practical implications. How do we get the power?

Now, this is where integralists go silent: they don’t know how to get the power. They don’t even think about it (maybe they do in some secret society).

Which means, they don’t really believe in the Kindship of Christ in the way they describe it. They are larping.

Even if they dream about getting the power, I’m sure they don’t think about *keeping* it. I mean, distributism, really? Against China? I bet they also think about abolishing the financial markets and imprisioning billionaires: whoops, and there goes technology to the sack. Craft? Yeah, sure, I love it too, but in wine, butter and cheese. Not on my Macbook.

Its like the doctrine of hell: they say the numbers of the saved are few and *extra ecclesiam nulla salus* in an almost Feeneyesque way. What do they do? They just twit about it and complain about the culture. Are they going to Saudi Arabia to convert? Are they even playing the holy fool in big cities? No. Because they don’t really believe it (even if they lack charity (which I don’t believe they really lack it), the lack of charity would scare them into doing it so they’d avoid hell).
