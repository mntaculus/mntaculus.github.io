# root of all evil

Why does St. Paul says the « *love of money is the root of all evil* » ?

In the context he says one should be content with food and raiment, and seek after godliness and that people who sought after money strayed from the faith.

But why money and not, say, power?

Certainly a modern person views money as power, or a proxy of power, in the sense that a person with more money can act more freely. And not only this, but can command others to act: as Carlyle says (half)jokingly:

« *and whoso has sixpence is sovereign (to the length of sixpence) over all men; commands cooks to feed him, philosophers to teach him, kings to mount guard over him,—to the length of sixpence.* »

Jokingly, yes, but true. Today one becomes free to the extent of ones wealth. A person can even escape ancient caste systems with money (good luck being a brahmin shop owner in the US while a untouchable is a tech bro; but of course, this is not to deny there’s a correlation between money and caste systems: of course a person who has more access to the wealth of society is generally more capable of accumulating wealth for herself).

There comes a point that an individual can amass so much money that he can even choose the laws he is under, or even create his own laws. I mean, when some billionaires move, its like Argentina moving, or something.

All this is to say: money is really another way to get power — different from, say, being born in the right family or amassing military power (again, not to deny there’s no correlation between the two. But strictly speaking, there’s a theoretical divide).

And St. Paul also says to obey the orders of princes. This might imply that one form of power is more legitimate than the other. But is it?

There’s another *datum* in the whole story: the crucifixion and the resurrection. The crucifixion was the established, lawful power acting: it judged Jesus to be a criminal. It passed a sentence and it should be final. But the resurrection is God passing a sentence against this established, lawful power: it itself is criminal and Jesus is just.

So the throne is not more just than the market. And, of course, as a good bourgeois (post)modern person that I am, I’m actually inclined to think the power of money is more just: *usually* one gets money not through violence, but through peaceful negotiations (I know, I know. Many counter examples, but still, let’s think about this on this very narrow way we are reasoning). I mean, J. K. Rowling became richer than the queen not by imposing her law on her subjects and pretending she was protecting them from, say, the French. She became richer than the queen because she wrote books that somehow spoke to many individuals and they bought her books, watch the films, bought the merch and so on. Even the villain of our era, Jeff Bezos, he became a billionaire not by forcing anyone to buy from Amazon or forced the internet to use AWS (I know, there’s a trail of destruction of the proverbial small business; but, again, is not a Genghis Khan trail, even though it is a trail).

There’s the other hand, though: the merchant class was never seeing as good, historically, because it could simply move somewhere else and abandon the land it profited from. (But this is also not simply black and white. When the Rothschilds created the germs of today’s modern financial instruments, they created it in order to avoid being robbed by kings. What would you do? Simply lay down and die for a tyrant?. (Besides, and this is another subject altogether, but usury is wrong, yes, but one cannot compare lending to a poor widow or orphan to exploit their vulnerabilities and lending to a government so that it can go on wars or finance their extravagant lifestyle. Its completely different. To equate these two things under *usury* is simply to make classification errors.))

Anyway, I suppose the point is: these both forms of power have their merits and demerits. And (at least the way I’m reading) they were both judged by the gospels.

So, what gives?

I think I have a solution: the problem here is not really the form of the power, but it above every principle. And this is what St. Paul (I believe) means by *love* of money: the torah says to love God above all and this is confirmed in the gospels as the whole of the law. So one should have ordered loves: first of God. And then? Well, I suppose the things that participate in the attributes of God: the truth, the beautiful, and so on.

So, one should use/obtain money, which is power, ordered to these loves and not simply use/obtain money as its own principle — that’d be like power for power’s sake; a king of voluntarism, really.

And this should apply for the other form of power, i.e., political (or military; which is really the same as the political) power.
