Yājñavalkya says that the indestructible is that that does not eat and is mot eaten by anyone.

Indeed, this is to be beyond the chain of sacrifices: this is to be beyond change.

But what if the indestructible is given in sacrifice, and thus is eaten, so that those who are eaten could partake of the beyond?

In this way the cross is not only the fulfillment of the temple sacrifices, but of all sacrifices.
