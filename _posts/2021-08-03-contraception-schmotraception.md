So, what’s up with the contraception controversy within the Catholic Church?

I’ll preface this post by emphasizing that I’m nobody and nobody should listen to me (this is, as I’ve been told, the sanest thing I ever said).

But: I find the Aristotelean reasoning behind the Church’s teaching a bit troubling: I mean, how can rape be less severe than masturbation? This is what St. Thomas ends up defending after a strict syllogism, assuming those assumptions we’re familiar.

I also have my reservations towards celibate (or, sometimes, “celibate” — really, its much easier to be asexual or a masturbator alone than to be in a couple) priests legislating married life. A bit like laying a burden too heavy that they themselves are not willing to carry.

That’s thomism gone mad. Like DBH says, St. Thomas was a great metaphysician, not so great a theologian, though.
