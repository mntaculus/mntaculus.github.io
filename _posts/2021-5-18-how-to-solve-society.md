That’s an important question. That is: given a society (with history, guys; let’s not be physicists and model a historyless society so we can solve exactly those ugly non-linear, tensor equations), how do we solve it? 

There is a question of solving it to what. Maximize happiness? (then we would have to define it) Minimize violence? (is this the same? Also, what’s violence).

I myself see this problem as a dual problem: it is an engineering problem and/or a spiritual problem.

Now, I have to confess, I do consider myself a [trad](https://シ.xyz/2021/05/02/about-me). But not a trad purist, in the sense that I don’t engage in the proverbial culture wars and militate for some cause. My philosophy of change is very different from these hooligans, and is summarized in this passage from St. Pius X:

« *When we consider the forces, knowledge and supernatural virtues which were necessary to establish the Christian State, and the sufferings of millions of martyrs, and the light given by the Fathers and Doctors of the Church, and of the self-sacrifice of all the heroes of charity, and a powerful hierarchy ordained in heaven, and the streams of Divine Grace—the whole having been built up, bound together, and impregnated by the life and spirit of Jesus Christ, the Wisdom of God, the Word made man—when we think, I say, of all this, it is frightening to behold new apostles eagerly attempting to do better by a common interchange of vague idealism and civic virtues.* »

Of course he was talking about an ecumenical workers movement, and trads come generally in a integralist mold. But it, generally, hols true for every modern political movement: a change through some political/military mean.

The reader will notice that I’m shifting the problem slightly: we are now talking about change, in general. The question of political change is a simpler question (this is to satisfy the physicists).

We went from how to solve society to is it solvable?

I believe so, even though the quote above that I said I agreed with apparently contradicts this.

I am, in fact, not against political change. I think its mostly necessary. I mean, Singapore is a great example of how political change can be beneficial for the citizenry. There are many examples, really: from the UAE to working class cities in the EU, e.g., Bilbao, Lisbon, etc.

There are also failed examples: Brazil as a whole, London, some parts of the USA.

There are mixed examples, the most famous being China.

But I do not confuse this (like integralists or conservatives *and* leftists, in general) with building a civilization. Having a good state so that one can live one’s life is, really, an engineering problem. Building a civilization is a spiritual issue. And this is really the issue: to not only build a safe, efficient, pleasurable place we can’t apply the same principles as we did to make the place that way.

That’s why I believe, when it comes to civilization, the best way to do it is to simply construct monasteries, and slowly one builds up — again, through grace, self-sacrifice, suffering and wisdom — a community and then one grows (through rhetoric rather than through dialectics) this civilization.

Many integralists admire Iran, even though the theological content of a Catholic integralist is very different from the content of a Muslim one; but, in reality, Iran is an example of a failed integralist state: and it failed, imo, because it treated a spiritual question as a pragmatic one.

Really, I believe that a true civilization must be in a good state — its a necessary condition.
