The other thing about this conservative Catholic position (if we could call  a doctrine that most people cite Paul VI’s teachings as a major reference conservative) is this: how come NFP is allowed?

I mean, the sin is in the will: someone wills to have sexual relations (or even sexual adjacent relations — another absurd is this: every romantic act should necessarily lead to full intercourse) without conceiving. The sin should be in this willing, not in the manner one procures this.

I suppose that at this point its not even about defending the edifice of Aristotelean/Thomistic system anymore. Its really about just defending this contradictory position.
